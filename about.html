    The Plan for this page (at a basic level and for now) is to have images of certain operational aspects. This is paired
    with text intended to essentially 'sell' the company's services. It's about the services the company provides more than
    who they are or where they came from. Might rename the page at some point to service this vision in the future.

    Could rename this page to 'operations' or something similar, then just have a collection of images that are annotated.
    This would require A: a decent supply of high-quality and relevant images and B: animating the annotations if I
    could be bothered, but that probably needs some TypeScript

    Upon further reading, I can compile my TS into JS, then just link the js file to the HTML, which will work for basic
    animations like this.
